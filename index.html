                    <h1 class="leftTitle">About</h1>
                    <p class="leftTitleContent">Codehort is a new, experimental, and free alternative to a coding bootcamp. It leverages the power of peer learning and the abundance of online resources to turn novice coders into full-stack web developers in five months. There are no instructors; just like a working programmer, you’ll use your problem solving skills, your colleagues (and a healthy dose of Google) to work through the material, learn fundamental concepts, and build an impressive portfolio of projects.  
                            <br><br>
                        Codehort unites open-source development curriculums with the structure, focus, and accountability of an immersive engineering bootcamp.  A five month commitment at 40-45 hours per week, participants will finish the course ready to begin applying to junior developer positions.

                <div id="who" class="leftTitleGrid">
                    <h1 class="leftTitle">Who</h1>
                        <p class="leftTitleContent">Codehort does not have any specific prerequisites. We believe that anyone can learn the material in the right environment. You should, however, be available to regularly participate in the group portions of the course during the day on weekdays.
                            <br><br>
                            As part of the first “Codehort,” you’ll actively participate in improving the learning model: giving feedback, offering suggestions, trying new methods. We’re especially interested in people who have experience, either as a participant or a member, of groups where regular peer review is a core aspect of the work.  Teaching is a powerful way to solidify understanding of material; you’ll present, workshop, and review code on a weekly basis, so you should be prepared to work with others.

                        The first group is accepting applications through September 18th. You’ll then have two weeks to complete the first stage of the introduction to web development portion and make sure that you’re ready to commit full-time to the course. The first session will run from the first week of October through February, with breaks built in for holidays.

                    <h1 id="commit" class="leftTitle">What to Expect</h1>
                    <p class="leftTitleContent">Codehort will not follow a traditional school schedule. Rather than defined lecture times or tests on specific dates, the group will set weekly checkpoints.  There will be morning and afternoon check-ins, active group chats, pair coding and code presentations.  
                        <br><br>
                        Codehort seeks to create a model of learning that can be used by groups everywhere to supercharge their learning and stay accountable to their goals. You’ll be participating in a new project, with all the excitement, benefits, and challenges that entails.
